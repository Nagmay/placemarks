Need to do:
- Setting: Turn on/off sensor=true when map is embedded
- All placemarks: Show location names instead of slugs (link to just those like a real taxonomy)
- Settings: Allow option to set default gps lat lng and zoom for admin map
- Embedded map: Add "edit" link to markers displayed on map when user is logged in for quick editing!

Done:
- Settings: Allow locations in locations (via JSON)
- Shortcode: set defaults for gps and zoom
